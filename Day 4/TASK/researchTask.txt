Question :- To delete all records from the table while preserving the schema.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
@DeleteMapping
public String deleteEmployees(){
    return hws.deleteEmployees();
}

public String deleteEmployees(){
    empRepo.deleteAll();
    return "All employee deleted Successfully";
}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What this does:
- empRepo.deleteAll() â†’ Deletes all rows from the table.
- The table structure (schema) remains unchanged.
- It's equivalent to running DELETE FROM employee; in SQL.
