## FOR MY REFERENCE

##  **HTTP Status Code 502 – Bad Gateway**

###  What it means:

`502 Bad Gateway` means:

> The server acting as a **gateway or proxy** got an **invalid response** from the server it was trying to talk to.

In short:
 The **first server** tried to forward your request to another **upstream server**, but **something went wrong** there.

---

## Simple Example

### You  Server A (Gateway)  Server B (Actual App)

* You send a request to **Server A**.
* Server A sends your request to **Server B** (real backend).
* If **Server B is down** or gives a **bad response**, Server A shows you:
   `502 Bad Gateway`
